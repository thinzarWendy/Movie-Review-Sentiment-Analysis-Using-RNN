# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-RNN

This project is a web application that uses a Simple RNN model (with ReLU activation) to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The app is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input custom movie reviews and receive instant predictions.
